# Blinkit Clone
# Welcome to the Blinkit Clone Website Project

This repository contains a clone of the Blinkit website created using only HTML and CSS. The Blinkit Clone project aims to replicate the visual design and layout of the original Blinkit website while using only front-end technologies.

## Project Overview

Blinkit Clone is a static website project that demonstrates proficiency in HTML and CSS for web development. It replicates the user interface and design of the Blinkit website, showcasing various sections and components of the original site.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The clone website is designed to be responsive, ensuring a consistent user experience across different devices and screen sizes.

- **CSS Flexbox and Grid:** The layout of the website is built using CSS flexbox and grid to achieve a modern and flexible design structure.

- **Interactive Components:** Although this clone focuses on the visual aspects of the original Blinkit website, certain interactive components such as buttons and navigation links are included to enhance user experience.
